terraform init

terraform workspace list

terraform workspace new dev --> I'm in new workspace

terraform workspace new prod
terraform plan
terraform workspace select dev
terraform plan
terraform apply 


Now we have two ways of creation 
and their is  third ways
Create different repo for different env

In approach 1 
pros --> same code
cons --> same code for multiple env, you need to be very careful
because whatever changes you do that will apply to prod

In approach 2 
pros -->  same code 
cons -->  same code for multiple env, you need to be very careful
because whatever changes you do that will apply to prod.

terraform is maintaining same bucket that may cause errors and diffcult to maintain

In approach 3 
pros --> since everything is diff, you no need to worry
cons --> code duplication, you need to maintain 2 repos ( use case: large projects)
